                Release of version 1.89 of Lingua::EN::Inflect
==============================================================================

DESCRIPTION

The exportable subroutines of Lingua::EN::Inflect provide plural
inflections and "a"/"an" selection for English words.

Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are
provided. Where appropriate, "classical" variants (for example:
"brother" -> "brethren", "dogma" -> "dogmata", etc.) are also
provided.

Pronunciation-based "a"/"an" selection is provided for all English
words, and most initialisms.

Lingua::EN::Inflect also provides facilities for comparing 
words in a "number-insensitive" manner (that is, an eq-like
comparison in which "ox" and "oxen" compare equal).

In generating these inflections, Lingua::EN::Inflect follows the
Oxford English Dictionary and the guidelines in Fowler's Modern
English Usage, preferring the former where the two disagree.

The module is built around standard British spelling, but is
designed to cope with common American variants as well. Slang,
jargon, and other English dialects are *not* explicitly catered
for. However, the module does provide the ability to define new
plural forms (or redefine existing ones).

Where two or more inflected forms exist for a single word
(typically a "classical" form and a "modern" form), by default
Lingua::EN::Inflect returns the more common form (typically the
"modern" one). The programmer can, however, specify that
"classical" plurals should be preferred.
